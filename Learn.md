\*\*\* what happens if you apply display :flex on multiple inline elements using css class
when you apply it will behave like block element and there after you can apply
height and width to it.

poistion relative on outter div and inner div, which is used to intact with outter element
example: below example on navbar, which as multiple div's have position:relative and position absolute.

\*\*\*if there are 2 divs , outer div and inner div
then when you do padding on the outer div { padding:100px 200px} that means
your shrinking the width of the inner div
one way to shrink the inner div width when we have nested div's.

if you position on any element ex {postion:absoulte} and zindex, then below your
element will space below that element which is have zindex and position,
you can see with {background-color:lightblue} to see it cover below that element.
